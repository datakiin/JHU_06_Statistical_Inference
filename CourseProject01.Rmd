##Overview
This report is part submission for the class project in Statistical Inference - a course in the John Hopkins University Data Science specialization on Coursera.

As per the project webpage, this report investigates the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The project requirements are to illustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. The project report should:

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the         distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the       theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

##Building the Simulation
Fortunately, the simulation can be easily run in R using the rexp(n,l) function, where n is the number of exponentials and l or lambda, is a constant set to 0.2 for our report. The following R code is used:


```{r}
# Set random seed and initialize variables
set.seed(123456)
l <- 0.2     # lambda
n <- 40      # number of exponentials
s <- 1000    # number of simulations

# Create a data frame for the simulation size
df <- data.frame(mean=numeric(s))

# Iterate lambda to the number of simulations
for (i in 1:s) {
        sim1 <- rexp(n,l)
        df[i,1] <- mean(sim1)
}
```

##Comparing the Sample Mean with the Theoretical Mean

We can now compare the sample mean from our simulation with the theoretical mean given by 1/lambda. For the theoretical mean: 
```{r}
tm <- 1/l       # theoretical mean
format(round(tm, 2), nsmall=2)
```

The sample mean can be defined as the average of the iterated values:
```{r}
am <- mean(df$mean)
format(round(am, 2), nsmall=2)
```
